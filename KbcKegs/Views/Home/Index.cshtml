        <p>
            Assets are kegs or whatever we own that has a lifecycle worth tracking. Assets can be delivered, returned, cleaned and made available.

        <p>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Assets", "Index", "Assets", new { }, new { @class = "btn btn-primary" })</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Manage Customers</h2>
        <p>
            I imagine customers will generally be imported from Shopify or Xero. But for now just manage them through the 'customers' admin area (see the nav bar above)
        </p>
        <p>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Customers", "Index", "Customers", new { }, new { @class = "btn btn-primary" })</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Manage Orders</h2>
        <p>
            Similarly, orders will probably be retrieved dynamically from Shopify or Xero, or perhaps created ad-hoc. But for now just manage them through the 'orders' admin area (see the nav bar above)
        </p>
        <p>@Html.ActionLink("Manage Orders", "Index", "Orders", new { }, new { @class = "btn btn-primary" })</p>
    </div>
